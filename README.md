This is a React app for internal use. It exposes a form for inserting profiles that will be displayed in the Catalog Politic Website.

The project is built in React, using DynamoDB as database layer for persisting profiles. The form should produce JSON objects in the format contained in the project folder (profile.json) The interaction with DynamoDB should be done using GraphQL.
